# Project Outline

### Overview
Our group project will be a web application for Food Truck Co. X where customers 
will be able to learn more about the company via a homepage, be able to view a menu and place an 
order online and be able to login to an account to receive promotional offers and updates. The 
web app will also allow the owner to login and update the features as needed. 

The project was motivated by the clients' desire to promote Food Truck Co. X's visibility 
and to expand its customer base.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Personally, I will have to learn more about APIs, their implementation and which ones would
be best for this project. I will also have to brush up on how to create a secure login, escaping and 
how to properly protect against database injections.
